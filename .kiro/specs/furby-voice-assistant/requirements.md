# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a CLI-based therapeutic assistant that mimics the personality and speech patterns of a Furby toy. The system will process text queries and generate therapeutic responses using simple, broad-meaning advice delivered in whimsical Furby-style language, including authentic Furbish phrases. The system operates completely offline using lightweight processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI assistant to be easily accessible from the command line, so that I can quickly get Furby-style therapeutic responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the CLI command THEN the assistant SHALL start immediately and be ready for input
2. WHEN the CLI starts THEN it SHALL load the response database and keyword matching system
3. IF the CLI fails to start THEN it SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully
4. WHEN the CLI is running THEN it SHALL be responsive and ready for user input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to respond like a therapist but with Furby personality and language, so that I receive thoughtful guidance in an entertaining and whimsical way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is processed THEN the system SHALL select from pre-defined therapeutic responses using simple keyword matching
2. WHEN providing therapeutic guidance THEN the system SHALL use a library of simple, broad-meaning responses in Furby-style language
3. WHEN responding therapeutically THEN the system SHALL offer basic empathetic phrases and general validation without complex analysis
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL include Furby-like sound effects in text form (e.g., "me think...", "ooh!", "hehe")
5. WHEN providing therapy THEN the system SHALL sometimes respond in authentic Furbish language with simple therapeutic intent (e.g., "Dah a-loh" for encouragement)
6. WHEN using Furbish therapeutically THEN the system SHALL include English translations or context clues for comprehension
7. WHEN users express common emotions THEN the system SHALL match keywords and respond with appropriate pre-defined Furby-style empathy
8. WHEN offering advice THEN the system SHALL use simple, universal therapeutic phrases framed in playful Furby language
9. WHEN no keyword matches are found THEN the system SHALL respond with gentle, generic Furby-style phrases that encourage sharing
10. IF the system cannot process the input THEN it SHALL default to simple, supportive Furby responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a CLI interface to interact with the Furby therapist using text, so that I can get therapeutic responses in Furby-style language through a simple command-line interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the CLI command with a text query THEN the system SHALL process the query and return a Furby-style therapeutic response
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL operate entirely through text input/output
3. WHEN running the CLI THEN it SHALL display the generated Furby response in the terminal with appropriate formatting
4. WHEN CLI is invoked THEN it SHALL accept queries as command line arguments or provide interactive input mode
5. WHEN in interactive mode THEN the CLI SHALL prompt for continuous input until the user exits
6. IF no query is provided THEN the CLI SHALL start in interactive mode and prompt for input
7. WHEN displaying responses THEN the CLI SHALL format Furby language and sound effects clearly in text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the CLI assistant to handle errors gracefully, so that it remains stable and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide a friendly Furby-style error message
2. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL function completely offline without any network connectivity requirements
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and continue operation
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the CLI SHALL exit gracefully with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include timestamps and detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the CLI assistant to run efficiently, so that it operates smoothly and responsively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text queries THEN the system SHALL use minimal CPU resources and complete processing quickly
2. WHEN generating responses THEN processing SHALL complete within reasonable time for typical queries
3. WHEN running the CLI THEN it SHALL use memory efficiently
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the assistant SHALL continue to operate without degradation
5. WHEN processing queries THEN it SHALL use efficient string matching and response selection algorithms
6. IF the system is under heavy load THEN response times SHALL remain reasonable
